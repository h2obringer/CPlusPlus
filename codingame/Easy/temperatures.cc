* Difficulty: Easy
*
* NOTE: This program is not meant to be run anywhere else but the codingame IDE at www.codingame.com
*	as the input is given through the IDE.
*
* Problem Statement: In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the closest to zero.
*
* Rules: 
*	Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally 
*	close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures 
*	are -5 and 5, then display 5).
*
* Input: 
*	Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyze
*	Line 2: A string with the N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526
*
* Output: 
*	Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.
*
* Constraints:
*	0 â‰¤ N < 10000
