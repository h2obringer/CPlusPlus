* 
* Difficulty: Easy
*
* NOTE: This program is not meant to be run anywhere else but the codingame IDE at www.codingame.com
*	as the input is given through the IDE.
*
* Problem Statement: Produce ASCII art!
*
* Rules:
*	ASCII art allows you to represent forms by using characters. To be precise, in our case, these forms 
*	are words. For example, the word "MANHATTAN" could be displayed as follows in ASCII art:
* 
*	# #  #  ### # #  #  ### ###  #  ###
*	### # # # # # # # #  #   #  # # # #
*	### ### # # ### ###  #   #  ### # #
*	# # # # # # # # # #  #   #  # # # #
*	# # # # # # # # # #  #   #  # # # #
*
â€‹*	Your mission is to write a program that can display a line of text in ASCII art in a style you are 
*	given as input.
*
* Input:
*	Line 1: the width L of a letter represented in ASCII art. All letters are the same width.
*	Line 2: the height H of a letter represented in ASCII art. All letters are the same height.
*	Line 3: The line of text T, composed of N ASCII characters.
*	Following lines: the string of characters ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ? Represented in ASCII art.
*
* Output: 
*	The text T in ASCII art.
*	The characters a to z are shown in ASCII art by their equivalent in upper case.
*	The characters that are not in the intervals [a-z] or [A-Z] will be shown as a question mark in ASCII art.
*
* Constraints:
*	0 < L < 30
*	0 < H < 30
*	0 < N < 200
