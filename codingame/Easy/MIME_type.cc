* Difficulty: Easy
*
* NOTE: This program is not meant to be run anywhere else but the codingame IDE at www.codingame.com
*	as the input is given through the IDE.
*
* Problem Statement: MIME types are used in numerous internet protocols to associate a media type (html, image, video ...) 
*	with the content sent. The MIME type is generally inferred from the extension of the file to be sent. You have to write 
*	a program that makes it possible to detect the MIME type of a file based on its name. 
*
* Rules:
*	You are provided with a table which associates MIME types to file extensions. 
*	You are also given a list of names of files to be transferred and for each one of these files, you must find the MIME type to be used.
*	The extension of a file is defined as the substring which follows the last occurrence, if any, of the dot character within the file name.
*	If the extension for a given file can be found in the association table (case insensitive, e.g. TXT is treated the same way as txt), 
*		then print the corresponding MIME type. If it is not possible to find the MIME type corresponding to a file, or if the file doesnâ€™t 
*		have an extension, print UNKNOWN.
*
* Game Input:
*	Line 1: Number N of elements which make up the association table.
*	Line 2: Number Q of file names to be analyzed.
*	N following lines: One file extension per line and the corresponding MIME type (separated by a blank space).
*	Q following lines: One file name per line.
*
* Output: For each of the Q filenames, display on a line the corresponding MIME type. If there is no corresponding type, then display UNKNOWN.
*
* Constraints:
*	0 < N < 10000
*	0 < Q < 10000
*   File extensions are composed of a maximum of 10 alphanumerical ASCII characters.
*   MIME types are composed of a maximum 50 alphanumerical and punctuation ASCII characters.
*   File names are composed of a maximum of 256 alphanumerical ASCII characters and dots (full stops).
*   There are no spaces in the file names, extensions or MIME types.
