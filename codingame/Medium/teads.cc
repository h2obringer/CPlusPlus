* NOTE: This program is not meant to be run anywhere else but the codingame IDE at www.codingame.com
*	as the input is given through the IDE.

* Description:
*
* Problem Statement: Here at Teads we know that to maximize the impact of an advertisement, the
*	message needs to spread far and quickly. You are given data to calculate viral potential, 
*	represented by a network of people ready to relay a message to more people. We can assume 
*	this network contains no cyclic relation. For example, if person #1 has a relation with 
*	person #2 and if person #2 has a relation with person #3, then it is impossible for #3 to 
*	have a direct relation with #1. When an individual broadcasts a message, it is counted as 
*	a single step, meaning that the time it takes to broadcast the message is independant from 
*	the amount of people in direct relation with the individual. We will consider that this 
*	event will always take 1 hour. Here is an example with persons #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7 
*	and #8 linked like so:
*		1-2-3-(4-(5,6),(7-8)	(3 connects to both 4 and 7, 4 connects to 5 and 6)
*
*	Here, by choosing to start propagation of the message with person #1, 4 hours will be needed 
*	to share the message to the entire network: 
*		1.   #1 relays the message to #2
*		2.   #2 then relays it to #3
*		3.   #3 relays it to #4 and #7.
*		4.   #4 relays it to #5 and #6, while #7 relays it to #8
*
*	If we decide now to start the propagation with person #3, then only 2 hours are needed: 
*		1.   #3 relays the message to #2, #4 and #7
*		2.   #2 relays it to #1 ; #4 relays it to #5 and #6 ; #7 relays it to #8 
*
*	In this exercice, your mission consists in finding the minimal amount of hours it would 
*	take for a message to propagate across the entire network given to you as input.
*
* Input: 
*	Line 1: N the number of adjacency relations.
*	N next lines: an adjancency relation between two people, expressed as X (space) Y, meaning 
*		that X is adjacent to Y.
*
* Output: The minimal amount of steps required to completely propagate the advertisement.
*
* Contraints:
*	0 < N< 150000
*	0 â‰¤ X,Y < 200000
