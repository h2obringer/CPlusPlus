In this assignment I chose to implement my planets and asteroids as spheres.
I used a class to create the sun, then I used the sun as a parent class to most other objects. 
I chose to do this becaues all of the terrestrial objects had most of the same functions, the 
only difference is the value of the variables each class owned. So i overwrote all of the 
constructors to include different sized radii and start distances from the orgin as well as 
different orbit speeds. This way every object can move around independent from one another. 

I implemented my ships with triangle fans. I rendered them differnt colors to same time in creating a 
completely different ship. This was extremely helpful as I had limited time to work on this project 
and with all the requirements for this assignment time was a major issue. 

I spent a lot of time trying to implement the movement of the ship. I started out trying to move the ship through the world and trying to tranform the projection matrix as well so the camera would follow the ship. After many struggles I finally found out that 
this was not the way to go; that move all the objects in the world instead of the ship would get better results. 

Because I put so much time into the movement of the ship and could only get one axis to move correctly at a time i decided to break it up and make one ship move with angle increments in the x angles and the other ship move in the y angles. This saved me time as well. I couldn't get the functions from math.h to work for me so I did my own function with the typed in values of sin from angle ranging from 0-90. 

I wanted my aliens to look cool and I found a great coding example that provided the construction of torus shapes. I rendered my spaceships as such. I did not have enough time to implement their movement for it was last on my list to implement them. Neither did I have time to implement an object with varrying heights or do collision detection. I did not have time to create a alien's point of view either. 3-dimensional programming was a big jump and at the end I finally got the swing of things. I feel if I had another 2-3 days (given any other week) I could finish the other requirements of this homework assignment. This was exam week for me however and I averaged 2-3 hours of sleep so far this week. 

I actually ended up finishing up my selection process, ship movements, ship selection, different ship movements, helping items, and putting out aliens in the last 48 hours. I have worked on this program non-stop since it was issued out and I pride myself at how I got the ships to move how well they do through space. I tried matrix transformations and feel I got close but I couldnt get the camera to follow the ship the same way so I quit that approach after much frustration.

I finally managed to split my program up into multiple files. I had to used classes which is not what I wanted to actually do but it worked out in the end. That took me a little learning curve as well to get back into that since I'm not used to working with such big programs... 

I am actually still getting very weird errors. There seems to be an issue with declaring my sun object???!!! I will bring my computer in tomorrow for the presentation... Ugh.
