# This sample Makefile allows you to make an OpenGL application
#   whose source is exactly one .c or one .cc file under linux.
#   check the location of the X libraries on your implementation.
#
# To use this Makefile, you type:
#
#        make xxxx
#                  
# where
#       xxxx.c is the name of the file you wish to compile 
# or
#       xxxx.cc is the name of the file you wish to compile 
#       
# A binary named xxxx will be produced
# Libraries are assumed to be in the default search paths
# as are any required include files
#
#

# If make is typed with no arguments, this first rule takes charge,
# building just texturing.

# Explicit make rules for texturing to be sure dependecies are
# explicitly stated.

# bitmap.o should be recompiled whenever bitmap.cc or bitmap.h are
# modified.
bitmap.o: bitmap.cc bitmap.h

# directory.o should be recompiled whenever directory.cc or directory.h are
# modified.

#	$(CC) main.cc directory.o $(INCS) $(LDLIBS) -o main

#main1: main1.cc directory.o
#	$(CC) main1.cc directory.o $(INCS) $(LDLIBS) -o main1

# texturing should be recompiled whenever bitmap.o changes or
# texturing.cc changes.
